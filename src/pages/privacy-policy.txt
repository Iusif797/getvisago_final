Introduction: GetVisago Ltd (“GetVisago”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy and personal data of our users. This Privacy Policy (including our Data Protection Policy) explains what information we collect, how we use and safeguard it, and your rights in relation to your personal data. By using GetVisago’s website and services, you agree to the collection and use of information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We process personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws, including the UK Data Protection Act and UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ensuring your information is handled lawfully and transparently.
Information We Collect: In the course of providing visa facilitation services, we may collect several types of information from you, including but not limited to:
·	Personal Identification Data: Full name, date of birth, gender, passport details (passport number, issue/expiry dates, etc.), national identification numbers (if required), and copies of documents such as your passport, photographs, and any other documents needed for visa applications.
·	Contact Information: Email address, phone number, postal address, and other contact details to communicate with you regarding your application or account.
·	Travel and Application Details: Information about your visa application and travel plans, such as destination country, purpose of travel, dates of travel, flight and accommodation details (if needed for the visa), and any responses on visa application forms.
·	Payment Information: If you make payments on our site, we collect payment details (e.g. credit/debit card information or other payment method details) via secure third-party payment processors. We do not store full financial account numbers or CVV codes; such data is handled by compliant payment gateways.
·	Usage Data: When you visit our website or use our services, we may automatically collect technical data such as your IP address, browser type, device type, operating system, referring website, pages viewed, and the dates/times of access. We may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect preferences and usage statistics to improve our website’s functionality and user experience. (For more on cookies and analytics, see “Cookies & Analytics” below.)
How We Use Your Data: GetVisago uses your personal data only for legitimate purposes in connection with our visa facilitation services or as otherwise described in this Policy. Uses include:
·	Providing and Managing Our Service: We use the information you provide to prepare and submit your visa application to the appropriate government authorities on your behalf. This includes filling out visa application forms with your data, scheduling appointments if required, and communicating with embassies/consulates or visa processing centers. We will also use your contact information to update you on the status of your application and deliver the final visa decision or any documents to you.
·	Verification and Security: We may use personal data to verify your identity, confirm the accuracy of the information provided, and prevent fraudulent submissions. This helps ensure that visa applications are genuine and compliant with government requirements.
·	Customer Support and Communication: Your contact details (email, phone) will be used to communicate with you about your order or any inquiries. We may send service-related announcements or notifications (e.g. confirmation of application submission, requests for additional information, status updates, and delivery of visa results). These communications are part of our service obligation to you.
·	Improvement of Services: We may analyze usage data and feedback to understand how our website and services are used. This information helps us troubleshoot problems, improve our processes, develop new features, and enhance the overall quality of our visa facilitation service. Any analytics are typically performed on an aggregated or anonymized basis.
·	Marketing and Offers (With Consent): If you expressly consent, we may use your email or phone to send newsletters, promotional offers, or updates about GetVisago’s services. For example, with your permission, we might inform you of new visa services, special discount codes, or travel-related information. We will not send you marketing communications unless you have opted in, and you can opt out at any time. Any marketing we conduct will be in compliance with applicable spam and privacy laws.
·	Legal Compliance and Protection: We may process and retain personal information as needed to comply with legal obligations (such as immigration laws, anti-money laundering regulations, or lawful requests by public authorities). Additionally, if necessary, we will use and disclose information to enforce our Terms of Use or protect the rights, property, or safety of GetVisago, our users, or others (for example, to detect and prevent fraud, security incidents, or other harmful activities).
No Selling of Personal Data: We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for their own marketing or any other purposes. Your data is used strictly for providing our services and as outlined in this Policy. We only share your information in the limited circumstances described below, and always with appropriate safeguards.
Information Sharing and Disclosure: GetVisago treats your personal data with care and confidentiality. We will share or disclose your information only in the following cases:
·	With Government and Visa Authorities: As a visa facilitation service, we act as an intermediary between you and the relevant government’s visa-issuing authority. We will share the necessary personal data and documents you provided with the embassy, consulate, visa application center, or immigration department that is responsible for processing your visa. This is done solely for the purpose of submitting your application and obtaining a visa decision. Please note that those government entities will handle your data according to their own rules and regulations (for example, they may retain your data in their systems as per their policies). GetVisago is not responsible for the data practices of government authorities, but we limit what we send to only what is required for your application.
·	With Service Providers and Partners: We may use reputable third-party service providers to help us deliver our services, and your data might be shared with them under strict controls. Examples include:
·	Payment Processors: to securely handle payment transactions (as mentioned, your financial details are processed by these providers who are PCI-DSS compliant, and we receive confirmation of payment).
·	Data Storage and IT Providers: for secure hosting of our website, databases, and applications (e.g., cloud storage services or data centers).
·	Courier or Delivery Services: if physical documents (like original passports or visa stickers) need to be mailed to you, we would share the necessary contact details with the courier company to ensure delivery.
·	Operational Partners: In some cases, we might partner with local visa agencies or consultants if needed to fulfill your request (for example, if an in-person submission or interview scheduling is required in a particular country). In such cases, those partners will receive only the information required to carry out the service on our behalf and will be bound to protect it.
Every third-party service provider or partner we engage is contractually obligated to handle your data securely and only for the purposes of providing services to GetVisago, in line with this Privacy Policy. They are not permitted to use your data for their own purposes and must implement appropriate data protection measures.
·	For Legal Requirements: We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in response to valid legal requests from authorities (such as a court order, subpoena, or law enforcement demand). We will only disclose what is legally necessary and will notify you of such disclosure if permitted by law. Additionally, if necessary to enforce our own legal rights, to defend against legal claims, or to investigate and prevent illegal activities (like fraud), we may share data with our legal advisors or law enforcement agencies as appropriate.
·	Business Transfers: If GetVisago undergoes a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, reorganization, or sale of all or part of its assets, your personal data might be among the assets transferred to the new owners. If such a transfer occurs, we will ensure that the new owner is bound by terms that are at least as protective of your privacy as this Policy, and we will notify users (for example, via email or notice on our website) if their personal data is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
·	With Your Consent: Apart from the cases above, we will share your personal data with third parties only if you have given explicit consent to do so. For instance, if you ask us to coordinate with a travel agent, employer, or other third party in relation to your visa, we will do so with your permission. You are in control of whether we may discuss or release your information to anyone else. If, in the future, we ever consider using your personal information in any way not covered by this Privacy Policy, we will seek your consent before doing so.
Data Retention: We will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined above or as required by law. In practice, this means:
·	Application Data: Sensitive personal data you provide for a visa application (such as copies of passports, personal photographs, or supporting documents) is kept on our systems just long enough to complete the service and handle any immediate follow-up. Typically, once your visa application has been decided and the outcome delivered to you, we will retain the application data for a short period (a few weeks) in case of queries, appeals, or resubmissions. After this period, we permanently delete or anonymize the sensitive data, especially passport scans and personal documents, so that they are no longer identifiable or retrievable.
·	Account and Transaction Data: If you have an account with us or have placed an order, we may retain basic information about the transaction (such as your name, contact, service availed, payment record) for a longer period for record-keeping purposes, such as accounting, auditing, and legal compliance. For example, financial regulations may require us to keep payment transaction records for a certain number of years. However, this retained data will be limited to what is necessary (we might keep an invoice and basic details, but not the detailed application form or passport copy once those are deleted).
·	Communication Records: We may keep email correspondence or support chat records if you have corresponded with us, in order to maintain a history of your service requests and any issues resolved. These records are typically maintained as part of our business records and for quality control.
·	Usage Data: Website logs and analytics data are generally kept only for a short period in aggregate form. We might retain logs for security analysis for a few months, and aggregated analytics indefinitely, but this data does not directly identify individuals.
·	Deletion Protocol: When data is deleted, we use secure deletion methods. For digital data, that means either secure erasure or overwriting; for physical copies (if any) containing personal data, it means shredding or otherwise destroying the documents. Once deleted, the data cannot be recovered.
·	Exceptions: In some cases, we may need to retain personal data for a longer period if required by law or for legitimate business interests. For instance, if a dispute arises or if we are required to keep certain information by court order or government mandate, we will retain the specific data necessary until the matter is resolved. In all cases, retention will not exceed what is legally permissible, and we will ensure the continued privacy and security of any data retained longer than the typical period.
After the retention period ends, or upon your valid request for erasure, we will ensure your personal data is securely deleted or anonymized. Please note that even if we erase or anonymize your data from our active systems, it might remain in secure backups for a short duration until those backups cycle out; however, we have processes to eventually purge or destroy old backups as well, and we will not restore personal data from backups except if required for security, legal, or recovery reasons.
Data Security: We understand the sensitive nature of the personal information you provide, especially details like passport numbers and identification documents. GetVisago employs robust security measures to protect your data and maintain confidentiality:
·	Encryption: All personal data transmitted between your browser and our website is encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols (such as HTTPS/TLS). This means that when you enter sensitive information on our site (like filling out application forms or making payments), that data is encoded during transit to prevent eavesdropping. Similarly, we encrypt sensitive data at rest in our databases or storage, so that it is protected from unauthorized access even if our systems were compromised.
·	Access Controls: Internally, access to personal data is strictly limited. Only authorized GetVisago personnel and trusted partners who need to know the information to process your application or assist you (for example, a visa processing specialist or customer support agent) have access to your data. All such personnel are bound by confidentiality obligations. We employ administrative and technical controls such as role-based access, multi-factor authentication, and regular access reviews to ensure that even within our company, your data is not accessed without proper authorization.
·	Secure Infrastructure: We utilize reputable hosting services and cloud providers that have strong security practices and certifications. Our servers are protected by firewalls, and we regularly update and patch our software to address security vulnerabilities. We also run antivirus and security monitoring tools to detect and prevent any intrusion or malware threats.
·	Employee Training and Policies: All GetVisago staff are trained in data protection best practices. We have internal policies to ensure that personal data is handled and disposed of properly. Any breach of data handling protocols by staff can result in disciplinary action.
·	Third-Party Security: When we use third-party service providers (as described above), we choose providers who also implement high standards of security. We do our due diligence to ensure they have measures like encryption, compliance with security standards (e.g., PCI-DSS for payments), and we have data processing agreements in place requiring them to protect your data.
·	No Absolute Guarantee: While we strive to protect your personal information with strong security, it’s important to note that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of information. However, in the unlikely event of a data breach or security incident affecting your personal data, we will follow all applicable laws in notifying you and the authorities, and we will take immediate steps to mitigate the impact and prevent any further unauthorized access.
By using our service, you acknowledge that you understand these security measures and their limitations. We encourage you as well to take precautions when using any online service: use strong passwords, keep your login credentials confidential, and contact us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account or information.
Cookies & Analytics: Our website uses “cookies” and similar technologies to enhance user experience and to collect information about usage. Cookies are small text files placed on your device that allow us to recognize your browser and capture certain information. For example, we use cookies to remember your preferences (such as language or login session), to keep you logged in as you navigate our site, and to understand how visitors interact with our site.
·	Types of Cookies: We may use both session cookies (which expire when you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them). Some cookies are strictly necessary for the site to function (for instance, to remember items in your application form as you fill it out). Others are analytical/performance cookies that help us improve our website by providing insight into how users move through the site (for example, which pages are visited most). We might also use functionality cookies to remember choices you make (like your preferred currency or country) to provide a more personalized experience. We do not use cookies to deliver third-party advertisements, and we do not collect advertising identifiers.
·	Analytics: We use third-party analytics tools (such as Google Analytics or similar) to collect information about site traffic and usage patterns. These tools collect information like your IP address, browser type, referring pages, and time spent on pages. However, we configure these services to anonymize data where possible (for example, IP anonymization in Google Analytics) and we use the information purely for statistical analysis to understand aggregate user behavior. This helps us identify areas of the website that may need improvement and measure the effectiveness of our communications. The analytics data does not include personal details like your name or contact information, and it is not used to identify individual users.
·	Your Choices: When you first visit our site, you will be given the option to accept or reject non-essential cookies via our cookie banner or settings. You can always manage your cookie preferences through our website’s privacy settings or directly via your browser settings. Most web browsers allow you to refuse new cookies, delete existing cookies, or notify you to decide on acceptance. Please note that if you disable cookies entirely, some features of our site (like maintaining your session through the application process) may not function properly.
·	Do Not Track: Our website does not respond to “Do Not Track” signals by web browsers. Currently, there is no standard interpretation or practice for “Do Not Track” and, as such, we treat such signals like general browser preferences. We remain committed to honoring your privacy choices through the cookie consent mechanism and other privacy settings as described.
·	Third-Party Links: While our focus is visa services, our site may occasionally contain links to third-party websites (for example, an official government visa info page or a partner’s site for additional services). Clicking those links might allow third parties to set their own cookies or collect data. This Privacy Policy does not cover third-party websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any external sites you visit. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other websites.
Your Data Protection Rights: As a data subject, especially if you are located in the UK, EU, or other regions with comprehensive data protection laws, you have certain rights regarding your personal data that we respect and uphold. These rights include:
·	Right to Access: You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to obtain information about how we process it. We will provide this information, usually free of charge, within the legally required timeframes (typically within one month of verification of your identity, unless the request is unusually complex).
·	Right to Rectification: If any of your personal data we have is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to have it corrected or updated. For example, if you realize you provided a wrong phone number or your name was misspelled in our records, you can ask us to fix it.
·	Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten): You may request that we delete your personal data under certain circumstances. For instance, if we no longer need your data for the purpose it was collected, or if you withdraw your consent (in cases where consent is our legal basis) and no other legal ground for processing applies, you can ask us to erase your information. Note that certain data cannot be deleted if we are obligated to retain it by law (e.g., transaction records for financial regulations) or if the data is needed for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. However, we will always comply with such requests to the fullest extent required by law.
·	Right to Restrict Processing: You have the right to request that we limit the processing of your personal data in certain situations. For example, if you contest the accuracy of your data, you can request restriction while we verify the information. Or if you object to our processing but we need to determine if our legitimate grounds override yours, you can ask for the data to be “frozen” in the meantime. When processing is restricted, we can still store your data but will not use it further until the issue is resolved (unless necessary for legal reasons).
·	Right to Data Portability: To the extent that we process your information by automated means on the basis of your consent or for the performance of a contract, you have the right to obtain the personal data you provided to us in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transmit that data directly to another service provider if technically feasible. Essentially, this right allows you to reuse your data across different services. (Note: This right is generally applicable to a subset of data; not all information may be portable, especially if it includes data about other individuals.)
·	Right to Object: You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data in certain scenarios. If we are processing your data based on legitimate interests, you can object if you feel our interests are overridden by your privacy rights (unless we have compelling grounds to continue). If we process your data for direct marketing, you can object at any time and we will cease such marketing.
·	Right to Withdraw Consent: If you have given consent for any specific processing (for example, receiving marketing emails), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted based on consent before its withdrawal, and it will not affect processing that is based on other legal grounds. Once you withdraw consent, we will stop the specific processing that was based on it. For instance, if you opt out of marketing, we will stop sending you promotional communications.
·	Right to Lodge a Complaint: If you have concerns about how we are handling your personal data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. As a UK-based company, our lead supervisory authority is the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) in the United Kingdom. You can contact the ICO or your local data protection authority if you are in the EU or another jurisdiction. We encourage you to contact us first, so we have the opportunity to address your concerns directly, but you are free to approach the regulators at any time.
Exercising Your Rights: You can exercise any of the above rights by contacting us (see “Contact Us” at the end of this Privacy Policy). Please clearly describe your request – for example, specify which data you want to access, or which information is incorrect and what the correct information should be. For your protection, we will need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests (such as access or deletion), to ensure that we do not disclose data to an unauthorized person. Verification may involve answering a few security questions or providing proof of identity. We will respond to your requests as soon as possible and in any event within the timeframe required by law. If we refuse a request (which might happen if it’s manifestly unfounded, excessive, or infringing on others’ rights), we will explain our reasoning and inform you of your options.
Please note that these rights are subject to some conditions and exceptions. For instance, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another individual, we might not be able to fully comply (in which case we would redact where possible). Or if you request deletion of data that we are legally required to keep, we may not be able to delete it until the retention requirement expires. However, we will always communicate with you in such events and try to accommodate your request to the greatest extent possible.
Children’s Privacy: GetVisago’s services are not directed to children under 18, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from minors without parental consent. If you are under 18, you should only use our service and provide personal information with the involvement of a parent or guardian. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child without proper consent, we will promptly delete that information. Parents or guardians who believe their child may have provided us personal data without their consent should contact us immediately so we can take appropriate action.
Changes to This Privacy Policy: We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or for other operational reasons. When we make changes, we will post the updated policy on our website and update the “Last Updated” date at the top. If changes are significant, we may also notify you by email or by a prominent notice on our site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to review this page periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information. Your continued use of GetVisago’s services after any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of those changes.
Contact Us: If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or your personal data, please contact us. We are here to help and will gladly address any issues you may have. You can reach our Data Protection Officer or privacy team at:

Additional Legal and Operational Notes
Promotional Offers and Codes: GetVisago may from time to time introduce promotional campaigns, referral programs, or discount codes as a part of our marketing efforts. Any such promotions will have specific terms and conditions, which will be communicated through the offer details. Generally, promotions are meant to encourage usage of our service or reward loyal customers. For example, we might offer a “New Year Discount” code for a limited period, or a referral bonus where if you refer a friend, both you and the friend get a discount on your next order. All promotional codes are optional and provided at GetVisago’s discretion. We reserve the right to modify or cancel any promotional offer at any time. If we suspect abuse of a promotion (such as creating multiple accounts to exploit an offer, or using a promo code in violation of its terms), we can void the discount and charge the full price, or refuse service if necessary.
Promotional codes typically do not apply to government fees, only to our service fees, unless explicitly stated. Only one promo code can usually be used per order, and they cannot be combined with other offers. Promo codes cannot be redeemed for cash and are non-transferable unless the promotion says otherwise. If a promotion has an expiration date, it will not be honored after that date. If you have any questions about whether you can use a promo code or how an offer works, please contact our support before placing the order.
Third-Party Services and Partnerships: In delivering our services, we may cooperate with third-party service providers. This can include technology providers (like a secure document upload service), travel insurance partners, courier services, or local visa agencies in certain countries. We maintain high standards in selecting partners, aiming to provide a seamless experience comparable to industry leaders. Any third-party services offered through us or recommended by us are subject to their own terms and conditions. For example, if we facilitate the purchase of a travel insurance policy via a partner link on our site, that insurance is provided by the insurance company, not by GetVisago, and you will be subject to the insurance company’s terms/policy.
While we strive to partner only with reliable companies, GetVisago is not liable for the actions, omissions, or products of third parties. If you have an issue with a third-party product or service (for instance, a courier delay or an insurance claim issue), we will do our best to assist you or direct you to the right contact, but ultimately that third party is responsible for their service. We also do not share your personal data with third parties for their independent use without your consent, as covered in our Privacy Policy. Any sharing is strictly for fulfilling the service (e.g., giving your address to a courier, or passing info to a local partner with your knowledge).
Industry Standards and Compliance: GetVisago is committed to maintaining high professional standards, similar to those upheld by reputable competitors in the visa services industry (such as iVisa, Atlys, Visanet, and others). We continuously review our processes and security measures to ensure we are offering a service that is secure, user-friendly, and compliant with applicable laws and regulations. Our data handling practices are in line with GDPR and other relevant privacy frameworks, and we align our business practices with fair trade and consumer protection standards. We also monitor regulatory changes in immigration and e-visa systems worldwide to update our offerings and advice accordingly. While each visa service may operate slightly differently, we aim to be competitive in our transparency, pricing clarity, and customer support. If you ever feel our service falls short of these standards, we welcome your feedback so we can improve.
Communications and Consent: By using our service, you consent to receive communications from us electronically (via email, messaging, or phone). As noted, the primary mode of communication will be email. You agree that any legal requirement for communication to be in writing is satisfied by electronic communication from us (for example, we can send you notices or updates via email and it counts as “in writing”). You also consent to receive service-related SMS or WhatsApp messages if you provided a mobile number and if it’s necessary to convey urgent information (standard messaging rates may apply as per your carrier). For marketing communications, those will only be sent with opt-in consent, as covered in the Privacy Policy, and you have the choice to unsubscribe.
Termination of Access: In addition to the “Right to Refuse Service” noted in the Terms of Use, please be aware that we also reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to our website and services (including any user account) for maintenance or operational reasons, even if you haven’t violated terms. We will try to schedule downtime or maintenance during off-peak hours and notify users in advance to minimize inconvenience. However, in emergency situations (like security threats or major technical issues), we may temporarily suspend service access without notice until the issue is resolved.
Should your account or access be terminated (whether by you or by us), certain provisions of the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy will survive, including our rights concerning any content you provided, your obligation to pay any amounts owed, disclaimers of warranty, indemnities, and limitations of liability.
Complaint Resolution: We aim to provide excellent service, but if you are unhappy or have a complaint about any aspect of our service, we encourage you to contact us directly so we can address it. We have a customer service escalation process in place. Typically, you can email support or call, and if the front-line staff cannot resolve your issue, it will be escalated to a manager. We will acknowledge all complaints within a reasonable time (usually 1-2 business days) and provide a timeframe for resolution or response. Our goal is to resolve complaints amicably and to your satisfaction if possible. In the unlikely event we cannot resolve a dispute between us, you may seek remedies as outlined under the Governing Law and Jurisdiction section of the Terms of Use, or as provided under applicable consumer protection laws.
No Agency Relationship: Using our service does not create any joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship between you and GetVisago, apart from us acting as your agent to submit applications as explicitly agreed. In legal terms, except for that limited purpose, both parties remain independent contractors. You do not have authority to make commitments on our behalf, and we do not have authority to make commitments on your behalf beyond those needed to process your visa.
Notices: Any legal notices or communications required or permitted under these policies (for example, alleging a breach or providing formal consents, waivers, or terminations) should be in writing and given to us at our registered business address (with a copy via email for expediency). Our mailing address for such notices is: GetVisago Ltd, [Legal Address], United Kingdom. We may send legal notices to you at the email or physical address you provided when ordering, or through a notification on our website if appropriate.
Severability of Additional Notes: The clarifications and notes provided in this "Additional Legal and Operational Notes" section are intended to complement the main policies. If any part of these notes or the policies above is found to be in conflict with mandatory law or is invalid, the rest of the provisions remain in effect, as described earlier.
Policy Acknowledgment: The act of using our website or services, creating an account, or placing an order constitutes acknowledgment that you have read, understood, and agree to all the policies set forth in this comprehensive document: the Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Refund Policy, and Additional Notes. We highly encourage users to familiarize themselves with these terms to be aware of their rights and responsibilities. If you have any questions or need clarification on any section of these policies, GetVisago’s support team is available to explain or provide additional information.
Continued Improvement: The visa and travel landscape can evolve due to political changes, technology updates, and user expectations. GetVisago is committed to continuous improvement. We regularly update our content to provide accurate information, upgrade our security protocols to safeguard data better, and enhance our user interface for ease of use. If you have suggestions for how we can improve our policies or service (for instance, you notice a confusing clause or have a special concern about data use), please let us know. We consider user feedback valuable in refining our policies and operations to serve you better.
Conclusion: Thank you for choosing GetVisago Ltd for your visa facilitation needs. We understand that applying for a visa can be a stressful and complex process, and we are here to simplify that journey for you while protecting your interests. This comprehensive policy document is part of our commitment to transparency and professionalism. It ensures that both you, as the user, and we, as the service provider, have a clear understanding of expectations and obligations. We look forward to assisting you and hope that you have a smooth and successful experience with GetVisago.
Safe travels and good luck with your visa application!
