Refund Policy
This Refund Policy outlines the circumstances under which GetVisago may issue refunds for its visa facilitation services, as well as the process for requesting a refund. By using our services, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to this policy. Please read it carefully to know your rights and limitations regarding refunds.
General Principle: Our services involve expediting and handling visa applications, which often entails immediate costs and efforts once you place an order. As a general rule, all fees paid to GetVisago are non-refundable except under the specific conditions described below. When you make a payment, a portion of it typically goes towards government fees, and the remainder is our service fee. Government fees are always non-refundable (once paid to the authority), and our service fee is usually non-refundable once we have begun processing your application. However, we do recognize that certain rare situations may merit an exception.
Non-Refundable Items:
·	Government Visa Fees: All government or consular fees that we pay on your behalf for the visa application are strictly non-refundable. This holds true regardless of the outcome of the visa application (approved, denied, or if you cancel after submission). Government fees are payments for the processing of your application by a government agency; thus, even if the application is unsuccessful or withdrawn, the government typically does not refund these fees to us. Consequently, we cannot refund them to you. If, in an unusual scenario, a government does refund a fee (this is extremely uncommon and typically only done if no processing took place due to an error), we will pass that refund on to you promptly. Otherwise, please assume that once the government fee is paid, it is gone.
·	Completed Service Fees: If GetVisago has completed the service as agreed – meaning we have submitted your application and provided you with the outcome (visa or decision letter) – then our service is considered rendered in full, and our service fee is non-refundable. This applies even if the visa was denied or if you are dissatisfied with the outcome, as long as we provided the service correctly. Our fee is for the effort and expertise in processing your case, not for a guaranteed result.
·	Late Cancellations: If you request to cancel your application after the allowed cancellation window (explained below) or after we have already submitted your visa application to the authorities, no refund of the service fee will generally be possible. By that stage, work has been done and costs incurred (including non-recoverable government fees), making a refund infeasible. Additionally, if you simply change your mind or no longer need the visa after we have started processing (for example, you cancel your trip), that is not typically grounds for a refund, especially if processing was already underway. We urge you to be certain you want to apply for a visa and to inform us immediately if your travel plans change.
Eligible Refund Situations: While we maintain a no-refund stance in most cases, we do allow for refunds or partial refunds under specific and limited circumstances. These include:
1.	Cancellation within 24 Hours (Before Submission): If you place an order and then decide to cancel it, you may be eligible for a refund provided that all of the following conditions are met: (a) You contact us to request the cancellation promptly, preferably within 12 to 24 hours of placing the order; (b) We have not yet paid the government fees or submitted your application to the visa authorities; and (c) We have not significantly begun work on your application. In practical terms, because we aim to process applications quickly, there is a short window in which you can change your mind. If your cancellation request is received very quickly (within hours) and we have not started, we will cancel your application and refund 100% of our service fee and any government fee that was not yet paid out. If some minor processing work was already done by us, we may refund less any minimal administrative costs, but in most cases of early cancellation, a full refund of what you paid to us can be expected. Once we have initiated the process (for instance, if we have already paid the government fee or submitted the application), the opportunity for cancellation and full refund has passed. Example: You applied at 10 PM and paid, but an hour later you realize you made a mistake or no longer need it. You email us at midnight to cancel. We see your message first thing in the morning before processing, so we cancel the request and issue a refund of the amount you paid. If you wait 48 hours, by then almost certainly we have submitted it, so a refund would not be possible (except as per other clauses below if applicable).
2.	Service Error or Non-Performance: If GetVisago fails to deliver the service due to an error or omission on our part, we will take steps to rectify the situation or, if that’s not possible, issue a refund. This covers scenarios such as: We missed a submission deadline that was within our control and it caused the application to be void; we submitted the wrong information despite having the correct info from you (and that error led directly to a visa denial); or we failed to submit your application at all (through fault on our side, not because you didn’t provide documents). In such cases, if the mistake can be fixed (like re-submitting at our expense), we will do so, but if the opportunity is lost or the error is irreparable, we will refund some or all of the service fee depending on what portion of the service was rendered correctly. Note that if the error was on the part of the government (e.g., their system glitch) or due to incorrect information provided by you, that is not our fault and thus not grounds for a refund. Example: If we accidentally submitted your application with an error that we introduced, and the visa gets refused solely for that reason, we would refund our service fee since you did not get the benefit of a properly executed service. We might also assist in a reapplication at no charge as appropriate.
3.	Serious Delay Caused by GetVisago: We pride ourselves on prompt service, but if a significant delay occurs that is demonstrably due to our actions or negligence, we will consider a partial or full refund of our service fee. This refers to delays on our side of the operation, not delays caused by the visa-issuing authority. For example, if we promised to submit your application within 2 business days but, due to our internal oversight, we submitted it 10 days later and this delay causes you to miss your intended travel date or causes you significant issues, that would qualify as a service lapse on our part. We would own up to that and offer a remedy, potentially including refunding our service fee since we failed to meet the agreed service level. By contrast, if we submitted on time but the government’s processing took longer than expected, that is beyond our control and not our fault – that situation, while unfortunate, does not warrant a refund of our fee. Similarly, if a delay was caused because you took too long to give us needed information or documents, the onus is not on us. Refund for delay is strictly for delays clearly attributable to us not performing timely.
4.	Duplicate Payment or Service Not Rendered: If you accidentally made a duplicate payment for the same service (for instance, two identical orders) or if you paid for a service that, due to some technical error, we ended up not providing, we will obviously refund any redundant charge. Also, if we determine after payment that we cannot process your application (perhaps due to an eligibility issue or a sudden regulatory change) and we have to cancel, we will refund everything you paid since we are not providing the service.
5.	Partial Refund in Limited Cases: In certain very limited circumstances, we may offer a partial refund of our service fee even if we have done significant work, as a gesture of goodwill or fairness. These cases are evaluated case-by-case and are at our sole discretion. Examples might include: If your visa application was extraordinarily delayed by a factor outside our control (e.g., an unannounced embassy closure) and you missed your trip, we might not be obligated to refund since it wasn’t our fault, but we could choose to refund a portion of our fee as a courtesy or offer a discount on a future service. Or if you purchased a bundled service and one part of the service was delivered and another part could not be (for example, you paid us for visa assistance and a travel concierge add-on, but the add-on couldn’t be delivered due to external reasons), we would refund the portion corresponding to the undelivered component. Partial refunds are rare and not standard; they are usually offered in an effort to maintain customer satisfaction when something unfortunate happened that isn’t clearly anyone’s “fault” or is a shared responsibility. Acceptance of a partial refund by you will typically be documented in writing and may come with an understanding that it’s in full settlement of any claims regarding the service.
How to Request a Refund: If you believe you are entitled to a refund based on the above criteria, you must contact us in writing (email is acceptable) to request the refund. In your request, please include:
·	Your full name and contact information (email and phone associated with the order).
·	The Order ID or reference number of the visa application (as given in our confirmation email).
·	Date of purchase and amount paid.
·	A clear explanation of the reason for requesting a refund, including any relevant details (e.g., “I am requesting cancellation within 12 hours, please confirm no submission was made” or “There was a mistake by your team in the application” etc.).
We may require up to a certain number of days (typically 3-5 business days) to investigate and evaluate your request internally. We will reply to you confirming whether a refund is approved or not, and if approved, whether it’s full or partial, and any other relevant terms. Please note:
·	If your refund reason is based on a claim of error or non-performance by us, we will carefully review our logs, communications, and actions on your case. We may also reach out to you for more information or clarification during this review.
·	Submitting a refund request does not guarantee approval. We will assess eligibility against this policy fairly.
·	If you initiate a dispute or chargeback with your payment provider instead of contacting us first, that can complicate or delay the refund process. We encourage you to allow us to address your concerns directly via this refund request process. If a chargeback is filed, we reserve the right to contest it if we believe it’s not justified per our policy.
Refund Method and Timing: If a refund is approved, we will issue it via the same payment method that was used for the original transaction, unless otherwise agreed. For example, if you paid by credit card, the refund will be credited to that same card. If you paid via bank transfer, we’d return funds to the same bank account.
We aim to process approved refunds promptly, generally within 10 business days of approval. However, the exact time it takes for the refunded amount to reflect in your account can vary depending on banking channels or credit card processing times. It might take an additional few days (sometimes up to 10-14 days, especially for international transactions or certain banks) for the credit to appear in your account. If you have not seen the refund after two weeks from our confirmation, please contact us and also check with your bank or card issuer, as sometimes they can provide insight or expedite on their end.
If partial refunds are given, we will specify the amount and reason in our communication. You will receive a refund confirmation email or notice from us once we have processed it. We recommend keeping that for your records.
No Refund for Denied Visas or Government Delays: To reiterate a key point – if your visa application is denied by the government or if it takes longer than you hoped due to government processing, this is not a case for refund of our service fee. We understand it is disappointing to receive a rejection or to have a visa arrive late, but when you pay us, you are paying for the application handling service we provide, not for a guaranteed visa. The risk of refusal is something every applicant bears, even with professional help. We do not control the criteria or thoroughness by which governments review visa applications. Similarly, delays often occur due to background checks, request for additional documents, or just high volume at the embassy; these are outside our influence. We will keep you informed and do what we can (for example, follow up with authorities where possible, or inform you immediately if additional documents are needed so you can supply them), but these situations do not entitle one to a refund as our work is still being carried out.
Cancellation of Application: If you wish to cancel your visa application request, you must inform us as soon as possible. As noted, cancellations are only eligible for a refund if they occur very quickly after ordering and before submission. If you contact us to cancel after we have submitted your application, we can certainly halt any further work and avoid any further service charges, but the fees already paid will not be refunded except as allowed above. Additionally, please note that once an application is submitted to a government, it cannot usually be “cancelled” to avoid a decision; it will simply run its course and the visa will be granted or refused. If you no longer need the visa, you can let it run its course or the visa will just not be used, but the government will not cancel and refund their process.
Refunds for Delayed Services: In rare cases where a refund is given due to a serious delay on our part (per the earlier section), that refund is the extent of our liability. We will not additionally compensate for any consequential losses (like missed flights) as explained in our Terms of Use, and by accepting the refund you likely will be asked to acknowledge that it is provided as full and final settlement of the matter.
Chargebacks and Bank Disputes: We understand customers might feel inclined to contact their bank to dispute a charge if they’re dissatisfied. We strongly encourage you to go through our internal refund process first. If you initiate a chargeback for a transaction that was valid and delivered as per our terms, we will furnish the bank with evidence of your order, our services rendered, and this refund policy you agreed to. If a chargeback is granted to you by the bank, and we have reason to believe it was not in line with our policy (for example, a claim that the charge was unauthorized when it was in fact authorized, or claiming services were not delivered when they were), we reserve the right to pursue the amount owed through lawful means, which could include sending the matter to collections or legal action, and terminating any future business with you. This is to protect us from fraud or abuse of the payment dispute systems. However, if you truly have a concern, we are here to resolve it amicably.
Updates or Changes to Refund Policy: This Refund Policy may be updated occasionally (for instance, if we introduce new services or change our cancellation terms). The most current version will always be available in our comprehensive policy document (like this one) on our website. Changes will typically apply prospectively (i.e., to new purchases after the change). If you purchased before a change, the policy in effect at the time of purchase usually governs that transaction’s refund terms. We will not retroactively impose stricter refund terms on an existing order.
