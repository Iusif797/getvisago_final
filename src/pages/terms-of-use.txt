Acceptance of Terms: These Terms of Use (“Terms”) are a legally binding agreement between you (“User” or “you”) and GetVisago Ltd (“GetVisago”, “the Company”, “we”, or “us”), the provider of visa facilitation and related services. By accessing our website or using our services, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms, as well as our Privacy Policy (provided above). If you do not agree with any part of these Terms or the Privacy Policy, you must not use our website or services.
You represent that you are at least 18 years old and legally capable of entering into contracts. If you are using GetVisago on behalf of another person or an organization, you represent that you have the authority to bind that person or entity to these Terms, and “you” in these Terms will refer to that person/entity as well as yourself. Parents or guardians may use our services to assist minors in obtaining visas, but the adult will be responsible for any use of the service by a minor.
About GetVisago’s Services: GetVisago is a private visa facilitation service that assists clients (particularly Indian citizens, though we serve clients of various nationalities as permitted) in applying for travel visas to various countries. We are not a government agency or representative, nor are we affiliated with any government, embassy, or consulate. We do not issue visas; final visa issuance (or denial) is solely at the discretion of the relevant government authority. Our role is to provide guidance, form preparation, application submission, and related support to help you navigate the visa application process. By using our service, you appoint GetVisago to act as an agent on your behalf for the limited purpose of preparing and submitting your visa application and communicating with the visa-issuing authorities.
While we strive to offer expert assistance and up-to-date information, we cannot guarantee that your visa application will be approved. The decision to grant or refuse a visa lies entirely with the government of the destination country. Using GetVisago’s service does not guarantee a successful outcome, nor does it expedite the governmental decision process beyond the available options (except where we offer specific expedited processing service as allowed by the country’s visa system). All processing times we provide are estimates based on information from official sources and past experience, but they are not binding and can vary.
User Responsibilities and Obligations: By using our website and services, you agree to fulfill the following responsibilities:
·	Provide Accurate Information: You must provide true, accurate, current, and complete information at all stages of the visa application process. This includes filling out all application questionnaires on our site accurately and truthfully, and submitting legible and authentic documents. You confirm that all documents and information you provide to GetVisago are genuine and correct. Any false, misleading, or fraudulent information or documentation could result in the denial of your visa by authorities, cancellation of your application, and could even lead to legal consequences from the government (providing false information on a visa application is often a statutory offense). GetVisago will not be responsible for any consequences (visa refusal, bans, legal penalties) arising from false or inaccurate information you provide.
·	Submit Required Documents in a Timely Manner: Many visa applications require supporting documents (for example: passport copies, photos, invitation letters, travel itineraries, proof of funds, etc.). You are responsible for providing all such required documents by the deadlines we communicate. If we inform you that additional or corrected documents are needed, you must respond promptly. Failure to provide necessary documents or information in a timely fashion can cause delays, application rejection, or inability for us to complete the service. GetVisago shall not be liable for delays or failures in processing caused by your delay or omission in supplying information.
·	Review Your Application Details: We may assist in transferring your data onto official forms or platforms. Before we submit your visa application, we may provide you a summary or copy of the application details (especially if required by law or practice) for confirmation. You are responsible for reviewing and verifying the accuracy of all personal and application details (such as name spelling, passport number, dates of birth, travel dates, etc.). If you spot any error or omission, you must inform us immediately before the application is submitted. While we strive for accuracy, GetVisago disclaims liability for any errors in the application that were present in the information you provided or that you failed to correct during your review. Ultimately, the correctness of the application is your responsibility, and you will bear any consequences (such as visa denial or issues at immigration) of errors or inconsistencies.
·	Comply with Application Instructions: During the process, we might give you specific instructions (for example, how to format a photograph, how to notarize a document, or medical tests to complete if applicable). You should follow these instructions carefully. If an in-person appointment (such as biometrics or interview) is needed, we will inform you of the date, time, location, and any preparation required. It is your responsibility to attend such appointments punctually and with all required documents. Failure to comply with official requirements could result in visa denial, which would be outside our control and responsibility.
·	Use of the Website: You agree to use our website and services only for their intended lawful purposes – i.e., to seek assistance in applying for legitimate travel visas. You must not misuse the site in any way. Prohibited activities include: attempting to breach or circumvent website security; introducing malware or malicious code; data mining or scraping our content without permission; using automated tools (bots) to submit requests to the site; interfering with the site’s operation or other users’ use of the site; and any fraudulent or abusive behaviors. You also agree not to engage in any activity that could harm our service or reputation, such as posting defamatory feedback or misrepresenting our service. If you engage in prohibited uses, we may terminate your access and take appropriate legal action if necessary.
·	Account Security: If you create an account on our platform, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials. Do not share your password with others. You are liable for all actions taken through your account. If you suspect any unauthorized use of your account or a security breach, you must notify us immediately. We are not liable for any loss or damage resulting from your failure to secure your account.
·	Lawful Purpose: You confirm that you are applying for a visa for a lawful travel purpose (tourism, business, study, etc. as stated) and that you intend to abide by the terms of the visa and immigration laws of the destination country. You will not use any visa obtained through our assistance to do anything in the destination country that is illegal or not permitted by that visa category (e.g., you won’t work on a tourist visa, etc.). Furthermore, you agree that you will not request our services for any fraudulent or illegal purpose. We reserve the right to refuse service if we suspect a visa application may involve fraud, deception, or any illicit activity.
·	Communication: You must provide a valid email address and phone number and keep these up to date in our records. We rely primarily on electronic communication (email, and occasionally phone/WhatsApp as needed) to provide updates or seek additional information from you. You agree to check your email (including spam/junk folder) regularly while your application is in process. If we send you communications and you do not respond within a reasonable time (for example, a request for clarification or missing data), that could delay your application or even result in cancellation. GetVisago is not responsible for any negative outcome if we were unable to reach you with important information due to your unavailability or your failure to monitor provided communication channels. It is also your responsibility to ensure emails from us are not blocked by filters. We will consider communications to have been received by you within 24 hours of sending to the email or phone contact you provided.
By fulfilling these obligations, you help us provide you with the best possible service and improve the chances of a smooth visa application process.
Fees and Payment:
·	Service Fee and Government Fee: When you use GetVisago’s visa facilitation service, the total charges will generally consist of two components: (1) Government visa fees, which are the official fees charged by the country’s embassy/immigration for processing the visa (these vary by country and visa type), and (2) GetVisago’s service fee, which is our professional fee for the convenience, support, and processing service we provide. Our service fee is clearly stated at the time of checkout or order placement. We strive for transparency by providing a detailed price breakdown before you confirm your order. By proceeding with payment, you acknowledge and agree to pay both the government fee and our service fee.
·	Taxes: If any taxes (such as VAT) apply to our service fee as required by law, these will either be included in the price or shown separately during the payment process. We will issue receipts or invoices that break down the charges, including any applicable tax, for your records.
·	Payment Methods: We accept various payment methods (e.g., credit/debit cards, online banking, digital wallets) as indicated on our website. By providing payment information, you represent that you are authorized to use the payment method and you authorize us (or our payment processor) to charge the full amount due for your order. All payments are processed through secure, PCI-compliant gateways. We do not store your sensitive payment card details on our own servers beyond what is necessary to process the transaction.
·	Payment Timing: Typically, you must pay the full amount (service fee + government fee) upfront at the time of placing your application order. We cannot begin processing your visa request or pay the government fee on your behalf until the payment is confirmed. In some cases, where government fees must be paid directly by the applicant at a later stage (for example, at an embassy appointment), we will inform you; otherwise, we collect it upfront to streamline the process.
·	Non-Refundability of Government Fees: Government visa fees are always non-refundable, regardless of the outcome of your application. This is because these fees are determined and collected by the government, not by GetVisago, and once we pay them to the government or lock them in for your application, they cannot be reclaimed by us (even if a visa is denied or you change your mind). By using our service, you understand that the portion of your payment that constitutes government fees is not recoverable under any circumstance. (The only scenario where a government fee might be refunded to you is if we had collected it but not yet actually paid it to the government and you qualify for a cancellation before submission – see the Refund Policy section for details on that.)
·	Currency: Our prices may be listed in a specific currency (e.g., GBP, USD or INR). If you are paying from another country or in another currency, your bank or card issuer might charge currency conversion fees or use an exchange rate at their discretion. GetVisago is not responsible for any additional fees your bank imposes or differences caused by currency conversion. We recommend using a payment method in the currency shown to avoid potential conversion costs.
·	Receipts: After your payment is processed, we will provide confirmation of payment. Typically, you will receive an email receipt detailing the services purchased, the amount charged, and a reference/order number for your application. Please retain this receipt for your records. If you require a formal invoice for your company or any specific details on the receipt, you can contact us and we will do our best to accommodate.
·	Promo Codes and Discounts: GetVisago may occasionally offer promotional codes, coupons, or discounts (“Promo Codes”) that can reduce the service fee. Such Promo Codes are subject to any additional terms that may be provided with them (for example, an expiration date, specific applicable visa categories, or one-time use per customer). Promo Codes only apply to our service fees (not to government fees, which are fixed) unless explicitly stated otherwise. They have no cash value and cannot be exchanged for cash. Misuse of promo codes (such as sharing unique personal codes publicly when prohibited, or creating multiple accounts to use a single-use code multiple times) is not allowed. We reserve the right to cancel any discount or refuse a Promo Code if we determine it is invalid, expired, or obtained through improper channels. If you cancel an order that was made with a Promo Code (under an eligible cancellation scenario), any refund of the service fee will be at the discounted rate you actually paid, not the full service fee.
By submitting your payment, you agree that you are purchasing a service from GetVisago and that all sales are final except as outlined in the Refund Policy below. You also agree to bear any charges that may result from failed payments (e.g., overdraft fees or chargeback fees, if applicable, subject to the next point).
·	Chargebacks and Fraudulent Payments: If we suspect that a payment is fraudulent or unauthorized, or if a payment is disputed/charged back by the payer without valid cause, we reserve the right to suspend or cancel the associated visa application unless/until the payment issue is resolved. We also reserve the right to pursue any owed amounts and to involve law enforcement for fraudulent transactions. To avoid this, please ensure that you recognize the charge from GetVisago on your statement and contact us with any payment questions before disputing a charge with your bank.
Service Process and Completion:
·	Application Submission: Once your payment is confirmed, GetVisago will begin processing your visa application. Our team will review the information and documents you provided for completeness and obvious errors. (We do not independently verify the truth of your data beyond format and consistency; that responsibility remains yours.) We will then complete the necessary visa application forms on your behalf and submit them through the appropriate channel – this could be an online e-visa platform, an embassy’s application portal, or by preparing documents for you to submit or attend in person as the process dictates.
·	Communications During Process: We will keep you informed of key milestones. For example, we might confirm when your application has been officially lodged with the authorities, if biometric enrollment is scheduled, or if the visa has been approved. Any electronic visa or approval letter received, we will forward to you. If a physical visa (stamp/sticker) is issued in your passport, we will coordinate how you will receive your passport back (either via courier or instructions to pick up, depending on initial arrangement).
·	No Legal Advice: GetVisago provides guidance based on experience with visa processes, but we do not provide legal immigration advice. Any information on our website or from our agents is for general assistance. If you have complex immigration circumstances or need legal advice, you should consult a qualified immigration attorney. Our service is limited to administrative assistance and support.
·	Completion of Service: Our service is considered fully delivered and completed when the visa decision is communicated to you, or when we have delivered all expected deliverables of the service you purchased. In practical terms, this means that once the government has made a decision on your visa application (approval, denial, or issuance of a visa document) and we have passed that outcome on to you, our contractual service is fulfilled. For example, if you applied for a visa through us, upon either delivering you the visa (if approved) or conveying the refusal decision (if unfortunately denied), GetVisago’s obligation is met. We are not responsible for providing alternative outcomes or refunds due to an undesired decision by the authorities, as the decision-making is outside our control.
·	Post-Decision Assistance: We will provide basic guidance on what to do after you receive your visa or if your visa is denied (for instance, explaining any next steps or reapplication options, if available). However, any additional assistance beyond the initial application may require a new service engagement. For instance, if your visa is denied and you wish to reapply with corrections or appeal the decision (in countries where appeals are possible), that would typically be treated as a new service unless explicitly agreed otherwise.
·	Retention of Documents: As per our Privacy Policy, we do not keep your personal documents indefinitely. We advise you to save all visa-related documents we send you (visa approvals, receipts, etc.) in a secure location. We may not be able to retrieve copies months or years later once our retention period lapses. It is your responsibility to keep your travel documents safe.
Disclaimer of Affiliation and Authority: GetVisago is an independent service provider. We are not affiliated with or endorsed by any government or immigration department. Any visas or travel authorizations you obtain through our assistance are issued by the respective government authorities, not by GetVisago. The use of country names or visa names on our website (e.g., “India eVisa” or “US Travel Authorization”) is for identification and informational purposes only; it does not imply any official association with those governments. You acknowledge that you can typically apply for visas directly through official government channels, and that GetVisago is an optional service you have chosen for convenience and support. We charge a service fee in exchange for handling the process on your behalf, including providing information, reviewing your materials, managing the submission, and communicating with you throughout. We do not claim that our service is the only way to apply, nor do we guarantee any preferential treatment by using our service.
Furthermore, GetVisago and its staff do not have the authority to grant or deny visas. We cannot influence the outcome of an application beyond ensuring that it is correctly submitted. Any indications we provide about likely outcomes, processing times, or requirements are based on publicly available information and past experience, but these are not promises or guarantees. Final decisions rest solely with the immigration officers of the destination country, who may exercise discretion and request additional information or reject applications for reasons they often do not have to disclose fully.
Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability:
·	General Service Disclaimer: While we aim to provide the highest quality of service, GetVisago provides its website and services on an “as is” and “as available” basis to the maximum extent permitted by law. This means we do not make broad promises that our service will always be perfect or meet all your expectations. Specifically, we do not warrant that: (a) all information on our website (such as visa requirements, eligibility criteria, or application guidelines) is absolutely current, error-free, or comprehensive at all times (though we strive to keep it updated); (b) the process or timeline of visa issuance will meet any personal deadlines or travel schedules you have (we are dependent on government processing times, which can change or be delayed); (c) our website will be available uninterrupted or free from technical glitches or viruses (though we apply best efforts to maintain uptime and security).
·	No Guarantee of Visa Issuance: You explicitly acknowledge that obtaining a visa is never guaranteed. Governments have the sole discretion to issue or refuse visas, often without providing detailed reasons. They may also delay processing due to security checks, high volume, holidays, or other factors outside anyone’s control. GetVisago shall not be held liable for any refusal of a visa or delays in processing. A visa denial does not indicate any failure on our part, provided we submitted the application correctly according to the information and documents you provided. As stated, our service is fulfilled by delivering the decision to you, positive or negative. We do empathize with the inconvenience a rejection or delay might cause, and we will assist you in understanding next steps, but we cannot offer compensation for outcomes beyond our control.
·	User-Caused Issues: If any problem with your visa application arises from your breach of these Terms or your failure to meet your responsibilities (for example, you provided incorrect information, you didn’t disclose a fact that led to denial, you missed an appointment, or you delayed so much that your travel date is too near), GetVisago is not responsible for those issues. Similarly, if you choose to ignore our advice or the official requirements (such as traveling with an almost expired passport, or not obtaining required travel insurance when it’s mandatory), you assume full responsibility for the consequences.
·	Indirect or Consequential Losses: In no event will GetVisago or its directors, officers, employees, or agents be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. This includes, without limitation: loss of opportunity, lost profits or revenue, lost or spoiled travel plans, costs of rebooking flights or hotels, emotional distress, or any other inconvenience or expense arising out of or in connection with our services or these Terms. For example, if your visa is delayed or denied and you cannot go on a planned trip, we are not liable for the cost of your missed flight or hotel, or any other costs you incur due to the trip cancellation. We advise all travelers to make visa arrangements well in advance and consider flexible booking options or travel insurance to mitigate such risks.
·	Total Liability Cap: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the maximum liability of GetVisago to you, for any and all claims, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, arising out of your use of our service, shall not exceed the amount of the service fee you paid to us for that visa application. (This limitation does not apply to the extent any loss is caused by our willful misconduct or fraud, in which case legal remedies would apply, but there is no such scenario expected in ordinary usage.) By using our service, you agree that this cap on liability is reasonable given the nature of the service and the fees charged, and that without this limitation the service could be much more expensive or unavailable.
·	Force Majeure: GetVisago shall not be responsible for any failure or delay in performing our obligations (or any loss you incur) due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control. These force majeure events include, but are not limited to: natural disasters, wars, acts of terrorism, epidemics or pandemics, government acts or orders, system outages or internet failures, power failures, labor disputes, or other disruptive events. If such events occur, we will endeavor to resume service as soon as possible, but some visa processes might be suspended or delayed by the situation (for instance, an embassy closure due to political unrest or a pandemic). You understand such events are not our fault and accept that delays or outcomes affected by them do not constitute breach of our obligations.
·	Website Information: Any general information provided on our site (such as visa descriptions, eligibility checklists, or blog articles) is for convenience and general guidance only. Although we strive for accuracy, such content may not always reflect the very latest changes in law or practice. For official and up-to-date information, you should refer to the relevant government sources. We do not accept liability for any action you take (or fail to take) based solely on information on our website without confirming with official sources or our staff. Always confirm critical information, such as whether you need a visa for a particular destination, with either us directly or the official government site if you have any doubt.
·	Third-Party Links and Services: Our website or communications might include links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by GetVisago (for example, a link to an embassy’s appointment scheduling site, a travel insurance provider, or a partner’s service). We provide these links for your convenience or reference only. GetVisago does not endorse and is not responsible for the content, offerings, or privacy practices of third-party sites. If you choose to click those links or engage third-party services, you do so at your own risk. Any arrangement or contract formed between you and a third-party (for instance, buying insurance, or using a flight booking site we mentioned) is solely between you and that third party; GetVisago has no involvement and no liability arising from those interactions.
·	Technology Use: We utilize digital platforms to process applications (including scanning and uploading your documents to government portals). We cannot guarantee that government systems will function flawlessly or that their websites are free of errors. If a government online system fails or has bugs that affect your application (for example, a government eVisa site crashes and delays submission), we will do our best to manage the situation, but we are not liable for those external system failures. Also, we assume no liability for any loss of data or unauthorized access that results from issues inherent in internet communications that are outside our control (e.g., hacking of email accounts on your side, or your internet provider’s insecurity). We highly encourage you to use secure networks and practice good cybersecurity.
·	Limitation Exceptions: Some jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions or limitations of liability (for example, not allowing exclusion of liability for personal injury or fraud, or not allowing exclusion of implied warranties). Nothing in these Terms will exclude liability that cannot be excluded under law (for example, our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, or liability for our fraud). All other liability is excluded or limited to the fullest extent permitted by law. If you are using our service as a consumer (not for a business purpose), you may have statutory rights that override some of the disclaimers above, but no provision in these Terms affects your statutory rights as a consumer.
Indemnification: You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless GetVisago and its affiliates, and our respective directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives, from and against any and all claims, suits, actions, demands, damages, losses, liabilities, judgments, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs) that arise out of or relate to: (a) your use of the website or services, (b) your breach of any provision of these Terms or any warranty/certification you make hereunder, (c) your violation of any law or regulation or the rights of any third party in connection with your use of our service, or (d) any fraud, misrepresentation, or negligence by you in supplying information to us or to the authorities (including any fraudulent applications or misuse of visas).
For example, if you provide us with falsified documents and that leads to legal action against GetVisago (say, an investigation by authorities for submitting such documents), you agree to cover all costs and liabilities we incur as a result of your actions. This indemnity obligation will survive termination of your relationship with GetVisago and use of our services. We will promptly notify you of any such claim and will provide reasonable cooperation (at your expense) in defending it. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (in which case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of that claim).
Intellectual Property Rights:
·	Ownership: All content and materials on the GetVisago website, including (but not limited to) the text, logos, graphics, button icons, images, software code, and overall design and arrangement, are the property of GetVisago Ltd or its content suppliers and are protected by intellectual property laws (such as copyright, trademark, and database rights). “GetVisago” and our logo are trademarks or service marks of GetVisago Ltd. All rights are reserved.
·	License for Use: GetVisago grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use our website and content solely for the purpose of using our services (for example, reading visa information, filling out application forms, and interacting with our platform) for your personal, non-commercial use. You may not reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works from, publicly display, or commercially exploit any of our content without our prior written consent.
·	Prohibited IP Uses: You agree not to: (a) remove or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices on our site; (b) use any automated means (e.g., bots, spiders) to access the site’s data or content without our permission; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of any software or database on our site (except as allowed by mandatory law); (d) use our name, logo, or other protected content in metatags, keywords, advertising, or in any manner that suggests an association with or endorsement by GetVisago without authorization.
·	User Feedback: If you choose to submit feedback, suggestions, or ideas about our services (e.g., improvements or new features) or if you publicly post reviews or testimonials about GetVisago, you acknowledge that we may use this information without any obligation to compensate you. You grant us a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable license to use, reproduce, and incorporate any feedback or testimonial you provide into our operations or marketing, in any manner. We will not, however, misrepresent your feedback or attribute statements to you without permission; typically, we might use a positive review in our marketing materials with attribution like “Customer from Mumbai”. If you prefer we do not use your feedback publicly, please let us know when you provide it.
Right to Refuse or Terminate Service: We reserve the right to refuse service to any individual or entity at our discretion, to the extent permitted by law. Situations where we might refuse or cancel service include, but are not limited to:
·	If we suspect the visa application may violate any law or involve deceit (for instance, suspicious circumstances suggesting the applicant’s intent is not as stated, or documents appear fraudulent).
·	If the user has a history of chargeback fraud or abusing our refund/cancellation policies.
·	If you violate any of these Terms, or if your actions (online or with our staff) are abusive, threatening, or harassing. Our staff deserve respect; any form of harassment or inappropriate behavior towards our employees may result in termination of your application without refund.
·	If required by law or instructed by authorities (for example, if a government alerts us that a certain individual should not be assisted, or if export control laws prohibit us from providing services to certain countries or individuals).
·	If unexpected circumstances make it impossible to service your application (for example, sudden changes in law that prohibit third-party visa submissions). In such cases, we would explain the situation and, if appropriate, provide a refund for services not rendered.
If we cancel a service in progress due to no fault on your part (for example, we determine midway that we cannot process it), we will refund you any portion of our service fee for work not completed, and any government fee that was not yet paid out. However, if termination is due to your violation of these Terms or your provision of false information, we will not be obligated to refund any service fees (and as stated, government fees cannot be recovered once paid). We also reserve the right to take appropriate legal action if your conduct causes harm or loss to GetVisago.
Travel Compliance: Once a visa is issued to you, it is your responsibility to comply with all terms and conditions of that visa and the immigration laws of the destination country. GetVisago is not responsible for your conduct once you have the visa. For example, if you overstay your visa or violate its terms (such as working on a tourist visa), any legal consequences (fines, deportation, bans) are solely your responsibility. We urge you to familiarize yourself with the allowed duration of stay and activities under your visa. If you are unsure, consult official resources or ask us for clarification before travel. We will help explain visa validity and rules when delivering your visa whenever possible.
Similarly, you are responsible for ensuring you meet entry requirements beyond the visa itself. This may include carrying the same passport the visa is issued on, having proof of onward travel or accommodation if required, sufficient funds, travel insurance, required vaccinations, or any COVID-19 related entry protocols in effect. GetVisago provides general guidance but cannot list all possible entry requirements for every country or scenario. You should check the destination country’s official immigration website or advisories close to your travel date to ensure compliance. We are not liable if you are denied boarding or entry for reasons outside the visa issuance (for example, missing documents, health requirements, customs violations, etc., at the port of entry).
Governing Law and Jurisdiction: These Terms of Use, and any disputes or claims arising out of or in connection with them or our services, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without regard to its conflict of law principles. This choice of law is made as GetVisago Ltd is a UK-registered company.
You agree that any dispute or claim (whether contractual or non-contractual) arising out of or relating to these Terms or the provision of our services shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales. Typically, unless otherwise agreed, proceedings will be brought in the courts located in London, England. You and we both consent to the jurisdiction of such courts and waive any objections to venue on grounds of inconvenience or otherwise (forum non conveniens).
If you are a consumer residing outside of England and Wales, you may also have the right to bring proceedings in your country of residence under certain consumer protection laws. These Terms do not limit any consumer protection rights you have under the mandatory laws of your country, to the extent those apply.
Severability: If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, then that provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the rest of the Terms will continue in full force and effect. In other words, the invalid part will be severed and the remaining terms remain binding. For example, if a specific clause is deemed unlawful, the intent is that the rest of the agreement still operates as if that clause were not included.
No Waiver: Our failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Similarly, any waiver by us of a breach of any part of these Terms does not mean we waive any subsequent breach or waive the provision itself. All waivers must be explicit and in writing to be effective.
Modifications to Terms: GetVisago reserves the right to modify or update these Terms of Use at any time. If we make material changes, we will notify users by posting the updated Terms on our website with a new effective date, and we may also send an email notification to users who have active orders or accounts. It is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically for updates. However, once you have agreed to a set of Terms when placing an order, those Terms will generally govern that order throughout its lifecycle. If we update Terms and you continue to use the site or services after the effective date of the updated Terms, such continued use constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to any updated Terms, you should stop using our services.
Entire Agreement: These Terms of Use, together with the Privacy Policy and any service-specific instructions or conditions that were presented to you at the time of purchase (for example, any country-specific disclaimers or notes during the application process), constitute the entire agreement between you and GetVisago regarding the use of our website and services. They supersede any prior agreements, understandings, or communications (whether oral or written) relating to the subject matter. You acknowledge that you have not relied on any representation, warranty, or statement that is not expressly set out in these documents.
